# Trumpbot

This is a quick and dirty attempt to create from scratch an equivalent of [@DeepDrumpf](https://twitter.com/deepdrumpf).

You can find the tweets corpus in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/5czkdz/7375_donald_trump_tweets_in_excel_and_csv/).
The data are already in the data folder, you do not need to download it yourself.

I am still training the bot at the time, I will try to post examples generated by the bot at the end :) !
